  bio: "Carlos is a strong believer that the answer to life, the universe and everything is 42. He has been developing mobile applications for 4 years now. He first met Android during his master thesis at the University of Coimbra, Portugal – it was a rough start (although way better than Java ME); Cupcake was still on an early stage but since then we’ve come a long way and it is now a breeze developing for Lollipop – with an extraordinary new (material) design - and at the time of this writing, to Marshmallow. Working at WIT Software he has been developing several applications – currently you can find him working on the company RCSe applications for Android."
