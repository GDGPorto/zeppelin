  title: "Android TV Strangelove"
  description: "<p>The concept of a single device has been depreciated for years now. We have a smartphone on our pockets, a smartwatch on our wrists, a laptop on our desks, a tablet on our backpacks, a TV on our living rooms, etc. and although we have this diversity of devices, only recently they learn about the existence of each other and started to interact.</p><p>Ideas like receiving a call on our phones and answer it instead on the computer or using our devices as remote controls for a TV game are now possible.</p><p>Over the last years, our televisions have been losing our attention. They became difficult to use - we no longer have a small number of channels or 9 to 5 schedules which allowed us to watch a specific movie at a defined time -  for example, we want to watch a movie after a long day at work without pressing dozens of buttons and without watching through long commercials. </p><p>We want the same experience that we have on our computers or tablets. Manufacturers have been attempting to solve this problem by filling our TV’s with a large amount of applications that we might have opened once to see how they work - and well… they are still there… somewhere. From the last two Google I/O's, Google has been focused on releasing what they believe to be next TV experience - Android TV. Their proposal is an android set top box along with a new support library - leanback - as well as a defined set of designing rules which will allow the user to take the best experience from their TV’s. Moreover, you can use your mobile phone as a secondary device/or remote control increasing the number of features available and providing new ways to interact with your TV. On this talk I’m planning to give an overview of what is possible to do with this new system along with some code samples - what to do, why to do it and how you can do it, examples and pitfalls to avoid.</p>"

  title: "Angular 2 - Building Enterprise Apps"
  description: "<p>In a rapidly changing environment as is the Web, developing enterprise applications, destined to be in production for decades, is a serious undertaking. Choosing the right framework to work with can have the same impact as choosing the person you will be marrying: have you thought that it may be easier to change spouses than replacing an entire enterprise system?</p><p>At Critical Manufacturing we are building the next generation of our flagship product cmNavigo for the web and mobile devices. Using Angular 2, Typescript and Flux at its core, the new cmNavigo interface is designed to be used 24/7 by thousands of users every day in cross-platform and different size form devices across the world.</p><p>In this talk I will share the latest development challenges we are facing and how we are modeling the system to have the performance and stability our customers demand. We will explore how Angular 2 latest alphas are helping us moving in the right direction, embracing new standards and how we are managing our development environments to increase productivity.</p>"

  title: "Android Data Binding"
  description: "<p>In the I/O 15 Google introduced the Android data binding. This technology is going to change the way we create and manage Android interfaces (for good), and we will be able to use mature patterns like MVVM to drastically reduce the amount of code in our Activities and Fragments.</p><p>Despite being a technology still in beta phase and not ready for production, we will learn how it works to be ready to use it from the first day when finally published."

  title: "Break it. To make it."
  description: "<p>Testers vs Developers - should they fight to the death, or hug it out?</p><p>Software Quality Assurance area has been growing over the past few years. It's becoming more common each day to have testing teams working along with developers with the common goal of delivering software good enough to make them proud. In fact these two old enemies have become more close each day and this interaction has been proved decisive when it comes to software quality. But not everything is a fairy tale with a happy ending. Specially when it comes to mobile testing there are many challenges to overcome. Software complexity is increasing and the market is becoming more demanding. We want to do better and faster and cheaper. How to achieve that? For many organizations Automation is the answer. Want it faster? Automate. Want it cheaper? Automate. And then, you will have better. Is this the magical formula?</p><p>On this talk I will cover this topics, do some demonstrations and give some useful tips that developers can use to help testers on their QA quest.</p><p>Cause sometimes... the best way to make it, is to break it first.</p>"

  description: "<p>Think about a very good restaurant... Have you seen the kitchen? No? Probably is a huge mess. But will this fact change your dinner experience? Maybe not if it all works fine.</p><p>As customers we won't go to the restaurant thinking about the kitchen but for the food, the nice environment, the friendliness of the staff , among other variables.</p><p>In the end, all of these variables make you have (or not) a good dinner experience. This is what happens with any product or service and it's called User eXperience.</p><p>The Google Cardboard is a good example where you can have an awesome user eXperience of virtual reality while only spending 5 euros and owning a smartphone.</p><p>Why not take it for a spin?</p>"
